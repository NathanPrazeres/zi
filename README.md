# zi
Simple (yet terribly written) Python script to delete the :Zone.Identifier metadata files created when moving a file from Windows to WSL

A great shortcut for running this tool is to add the line
```alias zi="python ~/path_to_python_file"```
to the .bashrc file in the home directory. 
This makes it so that when you type "zi" into the terminal it runs the file from your current working directory.
