# zi

Simple (yet terribly written) Python script to delete the :Zone.Identifier metadata files created when moving a file from a Windows to a WSL directory.

A great shortcut for running this tool is to add the line:

```alias zi="python3 ~/path_to_python_file"```

to the .bashrc/.zshrc file in the home directory.

After doing to type ```source ~/.bashrc``` or ```source ~/.zshrc``` into the terminal and you're all set!

This will make it so that when you type "zi" into the terminal it runs the file from your current working directory.
